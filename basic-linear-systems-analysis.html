	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>In psychophysics, we attempt to characterize the visual system by means of
input-output relations.
We present an image to the observer (input) and we study how the
observer's response (output) changes as we change properties of the image.
Linear systems are about the simplest input-output systems and although
they are overly simplistic as a model for the entire visual system, they
often provide useful descriptions of behaviour in very restricted tasks
and with very restricted stimulus classes.
Apart from that, many important experimental paradigms are derived from
and inspired by methods that characterize linear systems.</p>
<p>This blog post will present the basics of linear systems analysis in the
context of psychophysics.
The characterizations in this post are &mdash; although theoretically
useful &mdash; of limited practical applicability.
Follow up posts will present methods that are more applicable in specific
experiments.</p>
<h1>Simplifying assumptions</h1>
<p>Formally, we can think of an input-output system as a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that takes
a collection of inputs <span class="math">\(x\)</span> together with some external variables <span class="math">\(t\)</span> (such
as time and location) and maps them to a collection of outputs <span class="math">\(y
= f(x, t)\)</span>.
In a strict sense, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> should be all the inputs that the system will ever
encounter and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> would then be all the outputs that the system will ever
generate from these inputs.
This allows for all kinds of interactions between inputs at different
times and locations, that would allow the system to model behaviours such
as learning.
This is obviously quite complicated to study which is why we will here
restrict our attention to <em>time invariant</em> systems, that do not change
over time.
For such systems, we can write <span class="math">\(y = f(x)\)</span>.
Note however, that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are still <em>vectors</em>.
For example <span class="math">\(x\)</span> could be a vector of the intensities of each pixel in an
image.
This allows for the fact that the system combines different pixel
locations to derive the output of a single output location.
However, by having the system be independent of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the reference to
other pixel locations can only be relative.
In other words, the system could combine <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> with <span class="math">\(x_{i+1}\)</span> for
arbitrary <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, but it could not combine <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> for a fixed <span class="math">\(t\)</span>
that's independent of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> itself.</p>
<p>The output form the linear system would also be a vector.
We could for example think of it as a vector of neural responses to that
image.
In psychophysics, we often have responses that are button presses; The
observer either pressed button 1 or button 2.
We can usually derive such a button press response from the vector <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
using methods from {tag}signal detection theory.
However, that will be a topic for another post.</p>
<h1>What does it mean if a system is linear?</h1>
<p>When I ask people what they think makes a function linear, they often say
something about a line.
Although that's not entirely true, it really doesn't capture the essential
part.
A function, such as <span class="math">\(f\)</span> here, is linear if it obeys what is called the
<em>principle of superposition</em>.
Let <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> be two possible inputs and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> two numbers,
then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is linear if</p>
<div class="math">$$
f(ax_1 + bx_2) = af(x_1) + bf(x_2).
$$</div>
<p>In other words, the response of a weighted sum of inputs is a weighted sum
of the corresponding outputs.</p>
<p>In order to really appreciate this point, let's rewrite the linearity
definition in two statements.
Then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is linear if</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(f(ax) = af(x)\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you prove that these two statements together are equivalent to the
definition above?</p>
<p>One implication of this is that we can characterize a linear system with
pretty sparse measurements.
Once we know the response to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we know the response to <em>any</em> scaled
version <span class="math">\(ax\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.
Furthermore, if we know the responses to two inputs <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span>, we
know the responses to their sum <span class="math">\(x_1 + x_2\)</span> through (2) and we even know
the responses to any weighted sum <span class="math">\(ax_1 + bx_2\)</span>.</p>
<h1>The impulse response function as a universal description</h1>
<p>Linearity becomes particularly powerful in combination with a set of test
inputs <span class="math">\(x_t, t=1,...,N\)</span> such that their weighted sums span all potentially
relevant inputs.
One combination of these test inputs are the impulse functions</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_t(i) = \begin{cases}
1, \mathrm{if}\; t=i\\
0, \mathrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$</div>
<p>Note that the index <span class="math">\(t\)</span> goes over both time and/or space.
Thus, if we have a system that ignores the time dimension, <span class="math">\(t\)</span> would be
space and the <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> would be images that are zero everywhere except for
the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-th pixel.
We can write every possible image <span class="math">\(a\)</span> as a sum of these single pixel images
<span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> by just multiplying each <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> with the image's intensity at location <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, i.e.</p>
<div class="math">$$
a = \sum_{t=1}^N a(t) x_t,
$$</div>
<p>Note that we use different notations here: <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a whole image and <span class="math">\(a(t)\)</span>
is the number that represents the intensity of that image at location <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
On the other hand <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> is a whole image and <span class="math">\(x_t(t)\)</span> would be one, while
<span class="math">\(x_t(s)\)</span> would be 0 if <span class="math">\(t\neq s\)</span>.
Thus, it is sufficient to know the responses of a linear system
to the <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> to know the responses of a linear system to every possible
image.</p>
<p>For one-dimensional input signals <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> and a time-invariant linear
system, we further find that</p>
<div class="math">$$
f(\sum_{t=1}^N a(t) x_t)(i) = \sum_{t=1}^N a(t) f(x_t)(i).
$$</div>
<p>Furthermore, because the <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span> are simply shifted versions of <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and
because <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is time-invariant, the response <span class="math">\(f(x_t)\)</span> will simply be
a shifted version of <span class="math">\(f(x_0)\)</span>.
Let's call <span class="math">\(f(x_0)=:h\)</span> the <em>impulse response</em> of the linear system <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, then we write</p>
<div class="math">$$
f(\sum_{t=1}^N a(t) x_t)(i) = \sum_{t=1}^N a(t) h(i-t) = (a*h)(i)
$$</div>
<p>The operation <span class="math">\(*\)</span> is called <em>convolution</em>.
Thus, we found that the response of a linear system is given by the
convolution of the input with the system's impulse response.
This statement applies for higher dimensional inputs as well, although the
convolution is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>The important point here is, that we can fully characterize
a time-invariant linear system if we know its impulse response. However,
the impulse response is fairly easy to measure compared to the response to
any arbitrary stimulus.</p>
